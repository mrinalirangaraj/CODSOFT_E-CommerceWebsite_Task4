 Task 04 E-Commerce Website

 An e-commerce website UI/UX project is the process of designing an online store that is both visually appealing and easy to use. The goal of a good e-commerce website is to 
 make it easy for customers to find the products they want, and to encourage them to buy them.
 
 A good e-commerce website should be:
 
 Visually appealing: The website should be visually appealing and easy to read. The use of colors, fonts, and images should be carefully considered to create a visually 
 appealing website.
 
 Easy to use: The website should be easy to use and navigate. The customer should be able to easily find the necessary information and make their purchases.
 
 Categorized: The products on the website should be categorized, so that customers can easily find the products they are looking for. The categories should be clear and 
 concise, and they should be consistent throughout the website.
 
 Searchable: The website should be searchable so that customers can easily find the products they are looking for. The search function should be easy to use and should return 
 relevant results.
